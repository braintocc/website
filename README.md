## Motivation
This application allows you to schedule publications (linkedin, mastodon, ...) to multiple systems from your second brain (Notion, ...)

## Installation

```
$ npm i
```

## Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
