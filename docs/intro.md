# Welcome

Welcome to the Brainto user guide! This guide shows you how to get started on using your second brain to schedule actions on the wider internet.


## What is Brainto?

Brainto is a scheduler that allows you to centralize your live in your second brain platform (like Notion), and integrate with other services around the internet.

## Is Brainto for me?

If you use more than one service online and tend to have to multitask and visit things all around the web and want to focus better on value and not the process, I would say this is a tool for you.

## Ready to get started?

Visit the [page](https://www.brainto.cc/) and [its repo](https://github.com/braintocc/service) and start exploring.
